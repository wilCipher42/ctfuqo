Exemple : 
- Give an elf bin that send api requests to an address, if not found fallback to an unsafe one , trick the app to actually ask localhost (Domain Name redirection but like locally) then build an api to answer wrong stuff to the app (that one is actually hard)
- Easier : make a script that sends images and ask u to tell what animal it is, expect inhuman time, so the guy either has to store all off the db images, and the hash+good answer , then compare and answer. Or use tesseract lmao

Anyways, for those challenges, the challengers actually have to build their tool.
